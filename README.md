# National Cipher Challenge 2019
### Ipswich School Team
##### Software used for the National Cipher Challenge 2019 - Ipswich School

### BUGS:
1. Clear score takes a string but sometimes will not work when a var string is inputted? 
2. Frequency analysis based key generation sometimes returns all 5% values

### TODO:
- [ ] Monoalphabetic Solver
    - [ ] Functions to specifically decrypt common cipher algorithms
- [ ] Transposition Solver
- [ ] Polyalphabetic Solver
- [ ] Improve ngram fitness efficiency
- [ ] Look on [NCC](https://www.cipherchallenge.org/) website and import text files copied from there for possible key data
- [ ] Find some typical log probabilities for english texts and for texts with different ciphers put through them to get a rough idea of ngram scores


### Variable naming conventions
- Please try to keep global variables to a minimum
- Variables should look like this: variableNameFirst NOT Variable_Name_First
