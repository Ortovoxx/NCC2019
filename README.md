### Ipswich School Team
##### Software used for the National Cipher Challenge 2019 - Ipswich School

### BUGS:
1. No current bugs

### TODO:
- [ ] Monoalphabetic Solver
    - [ ] Functions to specifically decrypt common cipher algorithms
- [ ] Transposition Solver
- [ ] Polyalphabetic Solver
- [ ] Improve ngram fitness efficiency
- [ ] Find some typical log probabilities for english texts and for texts with different ciphers put through them to get a rough idea of ngram scores


### Variable naming conventions
- Please try to keep global variables to a minimum
- Variables should look like this: variableNameFirst NOT Variable_Name_First

### Please do this!
- Before running the code change the directories to YOUR specific directory to find the NCC2019 folder
- When adding new features all functions must take lower case strings as an input and output, unless there needs to be an exception
